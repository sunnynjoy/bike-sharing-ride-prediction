Bike Sharing Ride Prediction
============================

Neural Network to predict bike sharing rides
--------------------------------------------

If we have a bike sharing company say XYZ and we need to predict how many bikes we need because we are losing important customers. If we have many bikes, then we are just wasting money.

We need tp predict from the historical data how many bikes do we need.

Steps to setup the environment:
------------------------------

conda create --name dlnd python=3

Next, for different OS, we have to to call it's corresponding activation code as shown below

Mac/Linux: >> source activate dlnd
Windows: >> activate dlnd

conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook

Load and prepare data from the data sets provided, train it and verify the output.
